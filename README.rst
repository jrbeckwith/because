Because
=======

``because`` is a Python library for consuming Boundless services like routing
and geocoding. For more details, see the documentation.


Building the docs
-----------------

Doc source is under `docs/`.

There is a Makefile generated by Sphinx. Use that. If you're on Windows, don't
bother me. Just kidding, but it's probably wise to use Cygwin.


Qt
--

When running on Ubuntu or other environments which do not support SSLV2, you
may see the following harmless console messages:

    qt.network.ssl: QSslSocket: cannot resolve SSLv2_client_method
    qt.network.ssl: QSslSocket: cannot resolve SSLv2_server_method

These can safely be ignored.
