What is it?
-----------

The Boundless routing service lets you get routes and step-by-step instructions
for traveling from one place to another. You can specify locations either with
latitude and longitude, or with addresses.

The actual data may come from other sources, like Mapbox, Mapzen, or a locally
hosted instance of an open source backend like Graphhopper or Valhalla. The
Boundless service unifies all these backends behind one common HTTP interface
and allows you to use them without having to sign up or use credentials for
each individual service. 

Due to the complexity of routing and the data it uses, there may be minor
variations in what data you obtain from different backends.
