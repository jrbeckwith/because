Reverse Geocoding

What is it?
-----------

The Boundless reverse geocoding service is not yet available.

When it is available, it will let you find addresses which correspond to the
latitude/longitude coordinates you provide.

The actual data may come from sources outside Boundless, like Mapbox, Mapzen,
or a locally hosted instance of Valhalla.


How can I use it?
