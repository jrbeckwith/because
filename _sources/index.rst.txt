   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

because
=======

``because`` is a library for using 
Boundless HTTP services including 

..
    :doc:`routing <services/routing>`,
    :doc:`geocoding <services/geocoding>`,
    :doc:`reverse geocoding <services/reverse_geocoding>`,
    and :doc:`basemaps <services/basemaps>`.

``because`` wraps these :doc:`services <services>` in high-level interfaces that
abstract away many of the ugly details, so GIS professionals and programmers
can get started quickly and focus on how they want to use the data.

If you want to dive right in, feel free to check out the 
:doc:`Installation Instructions <installation>` 
and :doc:`Quickstart Tutorial <quickstart>`.

Several `interfaces <interfaces>` are provided, each tailored to a different
environment. For example, one interface is tailored for use in most ordinary
Python programs and adheres to PEP 8, but there is also an interface tailored
for use from QGIS plugins or other Qt programs which expect to use camelCase,
QNetworkAccessManager, QObjects and signals. 

The library provides a "layered API": the core, lower-level components used to
make the high-level interfaces are also exposed, for reuse in cases where the
provided interfaces do not suit your needs. For example, if you just want to
know how to parse responses from the routing API, you can just use the part
you need.

.. note::

    To use Boundless services you will need authentication credentials.
