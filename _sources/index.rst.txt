   contain the root `toctree` directive.

because
=======

``because`` is a library for consuming Boundless HTTP services including 
:doc:`routing <routing>`,
:doc:`geocoding <geocoding>`,
:doc:`reverse geocoding <reverse_geocoding>`,
and :doc:`basemaps <basemaps>`.
``because`` wraps these services in high-level interfaces that abstract
away many of the ugly details, so GIS professionals and programmers can get
started quickly and focus on how they want to use the data.

If you want to dive right in, feel free to check out the 
:doc:`Installation Instructions <installation>` 
and :doc:`Quickstart Tutorial <quickstart>`.

Several interfaces are provided, each tailored to a different environment. For
example, one interface is tailored for use in most ordinary Python programs and
adheres to PEP 8, but there is also an interface tailored for use from QGIS
plugins or other Qt programs which expect to use camelCase,
QNetworkAccessManager, QObjects and signals. 

The library provides a "layered API": the core, lower-level components used to
make the high-level interfaces are also exposed, for reuse in cases where the
provided interfaces do not suit your needs. For example, if you just want to
know how to parse responses from the routing API, you can just use the part
you need.

.. note::

    To use Boundless services you will need authentication credentials.
    You can sign up at `Boundless Connect
    <https://connect.boundlessgeo.com/>`_.
