To consume BCS services, it is necessary to send a short-lived JWT token or an
API key. 

To send such information, a QGIS plugin must hold it in memory. The same
information may be available to any code running in the same process, which may
include other QGIS plugins.

If a QGIS plugin stores such information on the local filesystem or a database
that is shared by all QGIS plugins, that is also a way for other QGIS plugins
to get at that information.

What QGIS plugins seem to need is a storage that is only accessible to the
plugin using it.

On the other hand, someone could take my plugin, copy it, and then change it to
access my plugin's credential store.
