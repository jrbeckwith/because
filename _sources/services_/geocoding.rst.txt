Geocoding

What is it?
-----------

The Boundless geocoding service lets you find latitude/longitude coordinates
which correspond to textual descriptions like mailing addresses.

It is often the case that there are multiple matches. The service will present
all these matches to you, along with an estimate of how relevant each one might
be, so that you can decide for yourself what to do with the ambiguity.

There may be minor variations in what data you obtain from different backends.

The actual data may come from sources outside Boundless, like Mapbox, Mapzen,
or a locally hosted instance of Valhalla.
