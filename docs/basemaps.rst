Basemaps

What's this?
------------

Boundless provides access to basemap tiles as XYZ TMS services, in the same
style as Google, Bing, and OSM. Many of the basemaps are actually from Mapbox,
we're just providing another convenient way to use these.

To use basemaps, the HTTP client may need to present an Authorization header
containing a token from the token service. Since many clients make this hard or
impossible, it is also possible to authenticate by appending an API key to the
URL.
