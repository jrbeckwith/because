Quickstart

Here are some simple steps to follow to start getting data using `because`.

0. Sign up for a Boundless Connect account at
   https://connect.boundlessgeo.com/.
   This will provide the username and password that you will need to interact
   with any of the services.

1. :doc:`Install the Python package <installation>`.

2. Go read the pages on :doc:`services <services>` like :doc:`routing
   <services/routing>`, :doc:`geocoding <services/geocoding>`, and
   :doc:`basemaps <services/basemaps>`. Each of these pages has a usage example
   that you can run locally, but you will need to have your code supply the
   username and password you got from Boundless Connect.
